    <header><h1>Alana Witten & Tom Blue</h1><h2>Phishing Kits vs Financial Institutions - History, OSINT and Automation</h2></header>
    <section><h3>Speaker Bio</h3><p>Tom is a 3rd year student at Lancaster and intelligence analyst at CrowdStrike. He has a background in security engineering/research, particularly around embedded systems security, and most of his current work revolves around analysis/reverse engineering of nationstate malware.<br>
      <p>
      Alana is a final year student, graduating soon. She has worked in threat intelligence for almost 2 years, and then interned at Apple as a security engineer. Her previous research involves tracking criminal infrastructure and doxxing APTs. <br>
      When she is not nerd snipped by Bleeping Computer articles or CTF challenges, she can be found in a rock climbing gym or exploring new cafes, documenting them in an endless spreadsheet (https://brownbearsec.github.io).</p></section>
    <section><h3>Talk Abstract</h3><p>Financial institutions are prime targets for cybercriminals, and phishing kits have become one of the most effective tools in their arsenal. These pre-packaged, ready-to-deploy kits enable even low-skilled attackers to launch convincing campaigns that steal banking credentials, drain accounts, and fuel the underground fraud economy.<br><br>In this talk, we’ll explore the evolution of phishing kits, from early crude scripts to today’s sophisticated, modular, and service-based models. We’ll discuss how these kits are discovered, dissected, and analysed, sharing key trends, unusual findings, and real-world anecdotes from recent investigations. Additionally, we’ll take a closer look at the business side of phishing kit distribution—examining how cybercriminals sell, trade, and refine these tools in underground forums.<br><br>Join us as we peel back the layers of the phishing kit industry and reveal the mechanics behind one of the most persistent threats to the financial sector.</p></section>

    <section><h3>Speaker Bio</h3><p>Arohi Naik is a cybersecurity professional passionate about securing digital infrastructures with a focus on human-centered security. Holding a Master’s in Cybersecurity, she brings expertise in threat intelligence, incident response, and risk management, coupled with a deep understanding of how human behavior shapes security practices.<br><br>Arohi advocates for a human-centric approach, where psychology, culture, and individual behaviours play a pivotal role in creating resilient cybersecurity solutions. As a strong feminist, she is committed to fostering diversity and empowering women in the cybersecurity field.</p></section>
    <section><h3>Talk Abstract</h3><p>The rise of femtech—technologies designed to support women’s health—is transforming the way we manage personal health data. From period trackers to fertility apps, these tools offer unprecedented convenience and insights. However, with the immense potential for positive impact comes a serious risk: the privacy and security of our most sensitive data.<br><br>This presentation examines the growing concerns surrounding data collection and usage in femtech apps. While these applications help us understand our bodies better, they also gather highly personal information that, if mishandled, can expose users to security breaches, surveillance, and exploitation. Why is this an urgent issue? Because unlike fitness trackers or social media platforms, femtech apps deal with some of the most intimate and vulnerable aspects of our lives—our health, emotions, and behaviours.<br><br>The discussion will explore the ethical implications of data practices in femtech, questioning whether the data collected is truly necessary or if it’s being over-mined for profit. Can we trust that our data is being protected, or is it being sold to third-party advertisers?<br><br>Additionally, the presentation will discuss solutions for building a privacy-first future in femtech, focusing on decentralised development. Imagine a world where your health data stays where it belongs—with you. This talk will challenge developers, regulators, and users to rethink how we approach digital privacy in femtech.<br><br>Ultimately, the discussion will address truly at stake: our health, autonomy, and trust. It's time to demand more from the apps we use—and ensure that privacy is not sacrificed in the name of convenience.</p></section>

    <section><h3>Speaker Bio</h3><p>Calum Baird has over 9 years of law enforcement experience at Police Scotland including working as a Detective Constable in the Digital Forensics Unit before moving to Cybercrime Investigations - a department specialising in the investigation of cyber dependent crime including ransomware, network intrusion, and cryptocurrency fraud. Calum now works as a Digital Forensics and Incident Response Consultant at Systal Technology Solutions, a Glasgow based international Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).</p></section>
    <section><h3>Talk Abstract</h3><p>Forensic acquisition is an essential skill for digital forensics and investigating cybercrime and security incidents. The ability to forensically capture data using a repeatable process is necessary for ensuring the integrity of evidence, allowing findings to be presented and accepted in litigation and at court.<br><br>Whilst traditional deadbox forensic techniques are commonplace in forensic training courses there is one technique is rarely taught: extracting data from integrated storage laptops. <br><br>Prior to M.2 solid state drives (SSDs) becoming more widespread, embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC) storage was a popular storage option for laptops and notebooks offering a slimline, impact resistant, and fast storage option at a relatively low cost.  Many laptops and notebooks still in circulation still use eMMC storage including (but not limited to):<br> - ASUS E210/E410/E510 Laptops<br> - Acer Aspire 3 A317-55P/A315-58/TravelMate B3/BR1100C Laptops<br> - Lenovo Ideapad 1i/Slim 1i/3i Laptops<br> - HP Stream 11-ak0027na/14s-dq0518sa/11-ak0515sa/11-ak0516sa Laptops<br><br>Most digital forensics training courses focus on removing hard disk drives (HDDs) and SSDs to conduct forensic imaging and analysis however this is simply not feasible with eMMC storage given that they are embedded and often directly soldered onto motherboards.<br><br>This talk aims to provide guidance on the forensic acquisition of data from eMMC laptops/notebooks using Kali Linux, an open-source Debian-based Linux distribution.  In addition to allowing forensic acquisition of data on integrated (eMMC) storage laptops/notebooks this technique can also be useful in instances where you do not have the time and/or tools available to disassemble and reassemble a device with complex assembly, or instances where you need to travel light.<br><br>Whilst this is a blue team focused talk, the ability to image a laptop/computer without disassembly, particularly given that it can be completed with pocket sized flash storage, does have red team applications.</p></section>

    <section><h3>Talk Abstract</h3><p>We all know the "What to Do" about Cyber. But have we thought about the why? Did we create our own nightmare? Are we economically dependent on cyber criminals to actually reject or even consider reducing cyber crime? Despite all the efforts the danger dials are all pinned into red zone. Ian Thornton-Trump CD explores - with humour and jaded cynicism - why countries are doing what they are doing and why cyber criminals and nation state actors are creating "unholy alliances". The data and trends can give us a glimpse at what the future holds for the country, the cyber security industry and "the baddies".</p></section>

    <section><h3>Talk Abstract</h3><p>You see it on LinkedIn all the time. "Here's how you break into cyber..." followed by a list of resources longer than the average Christmas shopping receipt. Half the resources on the list are questionable at best, and there is no structure whatsoever. Then, the few poor souls who do actually grind their way through this arduous mountain of content, end up in an interview and realise that they're missing large portions of key knowledge.<br><br>This talk follows the paths of multiple people into the pentesting industry, from traditional degrees, to marine biology, to apprenticeships, and everything in between. There's more than one way to skin a cat, and contrived one-size-fits-all approaches are out of date - over the course of 50 minutes we will follow 4 from zero to hero. <br><br>Attendees can expect an honest summary of the pentesting industry - and it's not all sunshine and rainbows. We'll go through an average day in the life, a summary of the professional qualifications you'll need (and the ones you won't), alongside the mentality you need to survive as a hacker for hire.</p></section>

A Digital Nomad an international speaker, I've presented on Cloud Security and Incident Response at Ekoparty, FIRST, Virus Bulletin (three times), Hack.Lu, and various BSides events worldwide. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Security and an MBA (Master in Business Administration).</p></section>
    <section><h3>Talk Abstract</h3><p>Cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) are foundational to many critical infrastructures and enterprise applications, making them prime targets for attackers. In this session, we will not only explore the most relevant attack vectors cybercriminals use to compromise AWS infrastructures but will also simulate these attacks using known threat actor techniques in an adversary emulation context. From initial access to hardcore persistence, this talk will provide a comprehensive look at how attackers operate in AWS environments.<br>We will take a technical journey through the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by attackers at every stage of the threat lifecycle, aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. We’ll start by reviewing common methods of initial access, such as exploiting exposed credentials or vulnerabilities in services like IAM, Lambda, and EC2. From there, we’ll detail how attackers escalate privileges, move laterally, and evade detection from tools like CloudTrail.<br>The session will conclude with an in-depth look at advanced persistence techniques in AWS, including the manipulation of IAM policies, backdooring Lambda functions or Docker containers, and tampering with logs. Along the way, we’ll demonstrate how security teams can implement defensive and detection strategies to mitigate these risks. By leveraging AWS-native services and third-party tools, attendees will learn how to enhance their incident response capabilities.<br><br>This hands-on session will give attendees practical, technical insights into AWS security, adversary behavior, and how to better defend against sophisticated, persistent attacks. With only two slides and full hands-on experience, this talk ensures deep technical immersion.</p></section>
