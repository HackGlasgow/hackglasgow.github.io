There's more than one way to skin a cat, and contrived one-size-fits-all approaches are out of date - over the course of 50 minutes we will follow 4 from zero to hero.\n\nAttendees can expect an honest summary of the pentesting industry - and it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

        "talkAbstract": "Cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) are foundational to many critical infrastructures and enterprise applications, making them prime targets for attackers. In this session, we will not only explore the most relevant attack vectors cybercriminals use to compromise AWS infrastructures but will also simulate these attacks using known threat actor techniques in an adversary emulation context. From initial access to hardcore persistence, this talk will provide a comprehensive look at how attackers operate in AWS environments.\nWe will take a technical journey through the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by attackers at every stage of the threat lifecycle, aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. We\u2019ll start by reviewing common methods of initial access, such as exploiting exposed credentials or vulnerabilities in services like IAM, Lambda, and EC2. From there, we\u2019ll detail how attackers escalate privileges, move laterally, and evade detection from tools like CloudTrail.\nThe session will conclude with an in-depth look at advanced persistence techniques in AWS, including the manipulation of IAM policies, backdooring Lambda functions or Docker containers, and tampering with logs. Along the way, we\u2019ll demonstrate how security teams can implement defensive and detection strategies to mitigate these risks. By leveraging AWS-native services and third-party tools, attendees will learn how to enhance their incident response capabilities.\n\nThis hands-on session will give attendees practical, technical insights into AWS security, adversary behavior, and how to better defend against sophisticated, persistent attacks. With only two slides and full hands-on experience, this talk ensures deep technical immersion.",

        "talkAbstract": "Forensic acquisition is an essential skill for digital forensics and investigating cybercrime and security incidents. The ability to forensically capture data using a repeatable process is necessary for ensuring the integrity of evidence, allowing findings to be presented and accepted in litigation and at court.\n\nWhilst traditional deadbox forensic techniques are commonplace in forensic training courses there is one technique is rarely taught: extracting data from integrated storage laptops. \n\nPrior to M.2 solid state drives (SSDs) becoming more widespread, embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC) storage was a popular storage option for laptops and notebooks offering a slimline, impact resistant, and fast storage option at a relatively low cost.  Many laptops and notebooks still in circulation still use eMMC storage including (but not limited to):\n- ASUS E210/E410/E510 Laptops\n- Acer Aspire 3 A317-55P/A315-58/TravelMate B3/BR1100C Laptops\n- Lenovo Ideapad 1i/Slim 1i/3i Laptops\n- HP Stream 11-ak0027na/14s-dq0518sa/11-ak0515sa/11-ak0516sa Laptops\n\nMost digital forensics training courses focus on removing hard disk drives (HDDs) and SSDs to conduct forensic imaging and analysis however this is simply not feasible with eMMC storage given that they are embedded and often directly soldered onto motherboards.\n\nThis talk aims to provide guidance on the forensic acquisition of data from eMMC laptops/notebooks using Kali Linux, an open-source Debian-based Linux distribution.  In addition to allowing forensic acquisition of data on integrated (eMMC) storage laptops/notebooks this technique can also be useful in instances where you do not have the time and/or tools available to disassemble and reassemble a device with complex assembly, or instances where you need to travel light.\n\nWhilst this is a blue team focused talk, the ability to image a laptop/computer without disassembly, particularly given that it can be completed with pocket sized flash storage, does have red team applications.",

Also yes.\n\nThis talk will look at:\n- Common PowerShell Restrictions: A look into why organisations limit access to Windows terminals (cmd/PowerShell) and the common methods used to enforce these restrictions.\n- Bypass Techniques: Simple and effective ways to gain access to a PowerShell shell, even when restrictions are in place.\n- Detection Strategies: How to identify when these bypass methods are being used and what steps can be taken to prevent them.",

What's been going wrong for the last eighty years. Why there's no incentive to improve things. Why the Luddites had a really good point (and, of course, what happened to them and is likely to happen to anyone who challenges the way things are too loudly).",

        "talkAbstract": "Financial institutions are prime targets for cybercriminals, and phishing kits have become one of the most effective tools in their arsenal. These pre-packaged, ready-to-deploy kits enable even low-skilled attackers to launch convincing campaigns that steal banking credentials, drain accounts, and fuel the underground fraud economy.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore the evolution of phishing kits, from early crude scripts to today\u2019s sophisticated, modular, and service-based models. We\u2019ll discuss how these kits are discovered, dissected, and analysed, sharing key trends, unusual findings, and real-world anecdotes from recent investigations. Additionally, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the business side of phishing kit distribution\u2014examining how cybercriminals sell, trade, and refine these tools in underground forums.\n\nJoin us as we peel back the layers of the phishing kit industry and reveal the mechanics behind one of the most persistent threats to the financial sector.",

        "talkTitle": "Femtech and Data Privacy: What’s at Stake?",
        "talkAbstract": "The rise of femtech-technologies designed to support women's health-is transforming the way we manage personal health data. From period trackers to fertility apps, these tools offer unprecedented convenience and insights. However, with the immense potential for positive impact comes a serious risk: the privacy and security of our most sensitive data.\n\nThis presentation examines the growing concerns surrounding data collection and usage in femtech apps. While these applications help us understand our bodies better, they also gather highly personal information that, if mishandled, can expose users to security breaches, surveillance, and exploitation. Why is this an urgent issue? Because unlike fitness trackers or social media platforms, femtech apps deal with some of the most intimate and vulnerable aspects of our lives\u2014our health, emotions, and behaviours.\n\nThe discussion will explore the ethical implications of data practices in femtech, questioning whether the data collected is truly necessary or if it\u2019s being over-mined for profit. Can we trust that our data is being protected, or is it being sold to third-party advertisers?\n\nAdditionally, the presentation will discuss solutions for building a privacy-first future in femtech, focusing on decentralised development. Imagine a world where your health data stays where it belongs\u2014with you. This talk will challenge developers, regulators, and users to rethink how we approach digital privacy in femtech.\n\nUltimately, the discussion will address truly at stake: our health, autonomy, and trust. It's time to demand more from the apps we use\u2014and ensure that privacy is not sacrificed in the name of convenience.",

Are we economically dependent on cyber criminals to actually reject or even consider reducing cyber crime? Despite all the efforts the danger dials are all pinned into red zone. Ian Thornton-Trump CD explores - with humour and jaded cynicism - why countries are doing what they are doing and why cyber criminals and nation state actors are creating \"unholy alliances\". The data and trends can give us a glimpse at what the future holds for the country, the cyber security industry and \"the baddies\".",
